	/// - Parameters:
	///   - success:	callback to execute on success. Contains an array of `CLPlacemark` objects.
	///					For most geocoding requests, this array should contain only one entry.
	///					However, forward-geocoding requests may return multiple placemark objects in situations where
	///					the specified address could not be resolved to a single location.
	///   - fail:		callback to execute on failure. Failure may be a generic error or `LocationError.noData` if no
	///					placemark were found.
